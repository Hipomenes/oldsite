December 23, 2015.

- Just a day before Christmas. The *guajolote* is marinating, gifts are ready 
- Back in my [Oaxacan library](http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/12/15/oaxaca/) and next to my treasure **Acantilado book collection**, I've been casually reading Stefan Zweig's [*La curación por el espíritu: Mesmer, Backer-Eddy, Freud*](http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/la-curacin-por-el-espritu-130.htm) and Chateubriand's [*Memorias de ultratumba*](http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/memorias-de-ultratumba-101.htm). I was also mesmerized—cross reference intended—by Ivan Illich's *El género vernáculo*, by far Illich's most sophisticated and daring book. It was touching to find my emphatic, youthful markings, as they made my recall how much I struggled to read a book that surpassed my abilities when I was 17. I remember the feeling of being faced not with an argument, but with a continent, a feeling evidently instilled by the book's over a hundred titled footnotes.    
- As for more formal readings, I've been enjoying quite a lot Laura Dassow Walls' *The Passage to Cosmos: Alexander Von Humboldt and the Shaping of America*. I've undertaking the reading of Humboldt's work not only for a specific writing project, but also as a remedy for the blandness that minute historical research inevitably provokes.
