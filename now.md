- Just a day before Christmas. The *guajolote* is marinating, the *piñata* for my little nephew is fully stuffed, and we're slowly easing ourselves into the festive spirit.  
- Back in my [Oaxacan library](http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/12/15/oaxaca/), the presence of my treasured **Acantilado book collection** has been too appealing. I've been casually reading Stefan Zweig's [*La curación por el espíritu: Mesmer, Backer-Eddy, Freud*](http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/la-curacin-por-el-espritu-130.htm) and Chateubriand's [*Memorias de ultratumba*](http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/memorias-de-ultratumba-101.htm). I was also mesmerized—cross reference intended—by Ivan Illich's [*El género vernáculo*](http://www.ivanillich.org.mx/LiGenero1.htm), by far Illich's most sophisticated and daring book. It was touching to find my emphatic, youthful markings, as they made me recall how much I struggled to read a work that surpassed my abilities when I was 17. I remember the feeling of being faced not with an argument, but with a continent, a feeling evidently instilled by the book's over a hundred **titled footnotes**.    
- As for more formal readings, I've been enjoying Laura Dassow Walls' *The Passage to Cosmos: Alexander Von Humboldt and the Shaping of America*, a timely recuperation of Humboldt's legacy in North America. I've recently undertaken the reading of Humboldt's works and letters, not only for a specific writing project I'm currently engaged with, but also as a remedy for the blandness that minute historical research inevitably provokes. If declarations were still in order, I would declare myself a [Goethean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethean_science)/[Humboldtian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldtian_science).[^1]

[^1]: Which reminds me that I still have to check out Jorge Aguilar Mora's new book: *Sueños de la razón: 1799 y 1800*.
