<p>I’ve <a href="http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/11/24/motto/">written before</a> about the pleasures of knowledge according to a Roman academy and Kircher’s adoption of a Platonic motto on the beauty of knowing everything. Last night, a little before falling asleep, I stumbled upon Hugh of Saint Victor’s praise of <em>meditatio</em>, a practice closely related to the <em>lectio divina</em>. It is, without doubt, the most beautiful praise of intellectual work I’ve read, an activity that according to Hugh gives us, in Jerome Taylor’s elegant translation, a “foretaste of the sweetness of eternal quiet”. In <em>meditatio</em>, the rumination characteristic of the <em>lectio divina</em> is carried forth beyond the confines of the book and into the world.</p>
