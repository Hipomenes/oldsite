  In this post I will describe the principles behind this personal weblog, as well as things I plan to implement as I learn a bit more about Jekyll, and some basic CSS and HTML.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Every posts will fall within this 4 categories: <strong>Musings</strong>, <strong>Glimpses</strong>, <strong>Curiositas</strong>, and <strong>Rewritings</strong>. The first refers to notes and actual pieces. The second is nothing but a <a href="http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/07/01/commonplace/">Commonplace book</a>. The third is the log of my curiosity and is inspired by <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks/">Cosma R. Shalizi’s Notebooks</a>. The fourth is a little experiment in the age-old practice of copying, reformulating and plagiarizing.</li>
  <li>This blog focuses entirely on content, so the design will remain barebones. I will add an Archive or a Category Index to the sidebar, basic contact information, and nothing else.</li>
  <li>While Anagogias 1.0 is gone for good, I still fully endorse Andrew Simone’s <a href="https://github.com/asimone/justenoughismore">“Just Enough is More”</a> aesthetics and rationale. So I won’t implement tags, tag-clouds, calendars, and will stick to <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole/Lanyon’s</a> “Related Post” function. When I learn how to do it, I will make sure that the Home page shows only the most recent post.</li>
  <li>The only important departure from Simone’s original theme is that I will implement Disqus support in the future.</li>
</ul>
