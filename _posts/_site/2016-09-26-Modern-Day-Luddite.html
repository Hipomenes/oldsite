<p>This is an idea that crept into my attention (or what was left of it) a couple of years ago, and has since then become a conviction: that the Web 2.0, and particularly the social media ecology, have swiftly eroded the cognitive abilities that a few thousand years of literacy and pedagogy had hardwired into the human brain.</p>

<p>I will be adding to this post articles and videos that argue the same point.</p>

<p>The most recent, is <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html">Andrew Sullivan’s</a> passionate piece in the NYT’s Magazine. And then a now classic video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk">Cal Newport</a>, who’s been arguing for some years for that mid-century utopia that was the 9 to 5 schedule and the focused life.</p>
