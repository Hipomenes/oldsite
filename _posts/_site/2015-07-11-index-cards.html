<p>For the past few years, I’ve dedicated a shameful amount of time to read and think about note-taking and research and information organization. And while I’ve developed a pretty satisfying system for the former, using an across-the-board color code, the latter still puzzles me. I’ve certainly enjoyed books such as Ann Blair’s <em>Too Much to Know</em> and was dazzled by Patricia Falguières analysis of the Renaissance <em>Wunderkammern</em> as an instance of the Aristotelian topical tradition (a theme I really want to pursue when Life &amp; Work permits), but for the most part my reading has been oriented by the pragmatic need to fine-tune the archival system I’ve been building throughout my graduate studies. Now, as I prepare my dissertation, the system will be put to a test.</p>

<p>Most of what I’ve learned has come from the occasional scholar who has been generous enough to describe his or her digital workflow, but also from the swarms of productivity bloggers and GDT-mongers, and more recently from professional digital humanities promoters. In this post, I thought of putting together a list of articles and posts that I’ve found more enlightening. They’re in no particular order, other than the order in which they come to mind.</p>

    <p>“Some Idiosyncratic Reflections on Note-Taking in General and ConnectedText in Particular”, by <a href="http://www.connectedtext.com/manfred.php">Manfred Kuehn</a>. This is the latest piece I’ve read, and is by far the most thoughtful. While Kuehn’s essay was supposed to be about ConnectedText, an interesting early piece of software made redundant by newer solutions, his piece is a wonderful reflection on the use of archival systems as “thinking-machines”. His discussion of Niklas Luhman’s “Zettelkasten” is truly engaging, and far superior to those spawned by recent Luhman revivalists out there.</p>
