title: Confessions of a modern-day luddite
---

This is an idea that crept into my attention (or what was left of it) a couple of years ago, and has since become a conviction: I'm completely convinced that the Web 2.0, and particularly the social media ecology have swiftly eroded the cognitive abilities that a few thousand years of literacy and pedagogy had hardwired into the human brain.

I will be adding to this post articles and videos that argue the same point. 

The most recent, is [Andrew Sullivan's](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html) passionate piece in the NYT's Magazine. And then a now classic video by [Cal Newport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk), how's been arguing for some years for that mid-century utopia that was the 9 to 5 schedule and the focused life.
