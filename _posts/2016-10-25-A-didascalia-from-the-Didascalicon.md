title: Didascalia from the Didascalicon
---

I've [written before](http://hipomenes.github.io/2015/11/24/motto/) about the pleasures of knowledge according to a Roman academy and Kircher's adoption of a Platonic motto about the beauty of knowing everything. Last night, a little before falling asleep, I stumbled upon Hugh of Saint Victor's praise of *meditatio*, a practice closely related to the *lectio divina*. It is, without doubt, the most beautiful praise of intellectual work I've read, an activity that according to Hugh gives us, in Jerome Taylor's elegant translation, a "foretaste of the sweetness of eternal quiet".

(*nb*: I'm curious to see what Ivan Illich has to say about this passage.)
