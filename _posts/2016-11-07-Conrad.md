I learned about Joseph Conrad's "Preface" to the *Nigger of the Narcissus* thanks to a passage mentioned in [this conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GubdYZPYPg) between Ian McEwan and Steven Pinker. I went on to read it, and found it utterly enlightening. Here's the opening first paragraph, that I wish I could read every morning.
